# Methane-plume-detection-from-images

The goal of this project is to implement a classifier that predicts whether an image contains a methane plume or not. The project was implemented based on the course on AI for good in association with ESSEC-CentraleSup√©lec and QuantumBlack McKinsey, France.

# Dataset:
The original dataset is in .tif format, with 214 images containing a methane plume and 214 images not containing a methane plume. Now, to train our model we created four additional folders. The plume_training folders contain 192 images containg a methane plume and the no_plume_training folder has 192 images not containing a methane plume. The plume_testing folders contain 22 images containg a methane plume and the no_plume_testing folder contains 22 images not containing a methane plume selected manually at random.
